# cisc3140_lab3




This is the repo that contains the work I did for the group project.

I worked on Project 1 in the repo that was given to us.

I made an evaluation of the original code.

I added the new functionalities that were asked.

I added a flag function to the makefile so that you can choose to not output to the screen.

I updated the documentation.
